<h2>Tooling<h2>
<p>I used the TypeScript compiler to produce a .js file for every .ts file, and watchify to combine into one file</p>
<p>Other than that this project has no dependencies</p>

<h2>Further Improvements<h2>
<p>Allow user to select from a list of different heuristics (i.e manhattan, euclidean etc)</p>
<p>Learn CSS animations and animate pathfinding</p>
<p>Add further pathfinding optimisations and heuristics (i.e jump point search)</p>
