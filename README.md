<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>You can select lots of features from the menu to customise how you want an algorithm to run and in what environment</p>
<p>You can drag your mouse along the screen to draw either walls or weights depending on what you have selected in the dropdown menu</p>
<p>You can move the start and goal tiles by dragging and dropping onto another tile</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>I used the TypeScript compiler to produce a .js file for every .ts file, and watchify to bundle into a single .js file, which is linked from index.html</p>
<p>Other than that this project has no dependencies</p>

<h2>Further Improvements<h2>
<p>Learn CSS animations and animate pathfinding</p>
<p>Add further pathfinding optimisations (i.e jump point search)</p>
